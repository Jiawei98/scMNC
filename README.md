# Manifold learning analysis reveals the functional genomics at the cell-type level for neuronal electrophysiology in the mouse brain 

## Summary
Recent single-cell multi-modal data reveal different characteristics of single cells, such as transcriptomics, morphology, and electrophysiology. However, our understanding of functional genomics and gene regulation leading to various cellular characteristics remains elusive. To address this, we applied multiple machine learning approaches to align gene expression and electrophysiological data of single neuronal cells in the mouse visual and motor cortices. We found that nonlinear manifold learning outperforms others. After manifold alignment, the cell clusters highly correspond to transcriptomic and morphological cell-types, suggesting a strong nonlinear linkage between gene expression and electrophysiology at the cell-type level. Also, the aligned cells form developmental trajectories, showing the underlying neuronal development and continuous characteristic changes. We further clustered aligned cells into multiple cross-modal cell clusters and found that the clusters' differentially expressed genes can predict many electrophysiological features. Additional functional enrichment and gene regulatory network analyses for our cell clusters revealed potential novel molecular mechanistic insights from genes to electrophysiology at cellular resolution.
